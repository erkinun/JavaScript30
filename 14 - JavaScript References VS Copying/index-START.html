      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const newPlayers = Array.from(players)

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      players.splice(3, 1)

      console.log(newPlayers)
      console.log(players)

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const newArray = [...newPlayers]
      newPlayers.splice(3, 1)
      console.log(newArray)
      console.log(newPlayers)

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: 'Wes Bos',
        age: 80,
        social: {
          twitter: '@erkinun',
        },
      }

      // and think we make a copy:
      const newPerson = {
        ...person,
      }

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const some = Object.assign({}, person)
      some.age = 11

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      newPerson.age = 35
      newPerson.social.twitter = '@ibooo'
      newPerson.name = 'Erkin'
      console.log(newPerson)
      console.log(person)
      console.log(some)

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
